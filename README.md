# A New Framework of Swarm Learning Consolidating Knowledge from Multi-Center Non-IID Data for Medical Image Segmentation
This project is developed for the TMI paper: [A New Framework of Swarm Learning Consolidating Knowledge from Multi-Center Non-IID Data for Medical Image Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9943283). In this paper, we proposed LaSA and FeSA loss to deal with the Non-IID challenge in distributed learning for partially supervised image segmentation. For more information, please read the following paper:
